          I am a Junior Javascript FULL STACK Developer passionate about
          coding,web development and tech. I am a team player who strongly
          believes a team working together is always stronger than the sum of
          its parts.

          Full time course which focuses on learning by doing, using Agile
          methodology with Scrum. Over the course of 5 months I worked on
          simulated real-life projects for fictional clients which included real
          requirements and design specifications. Sprints would last one or two
          weeks and a code revision with mentors and course colleagues would
          conclude every project.
